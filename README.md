# FlashForge Client

This is an unofficial Python package to ease communicating with FlashForge 3D printers.

## Supported Printers

This has only been tested with the FlashForge Dreamer, but it should work with all printers that have the capability of being controlled by the FlashPrint application.

## Planned Features

- Make this an actual package
- Communication via USB

## Usage

Samples can be found [here](/samples/).

## API Documentation

A work-in-progress documentation of the FlashForge API can be found [here](API.md).
